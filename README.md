# WIaaS - Wavelog mapImage as a Service

## Masterlist for the Wavelog-Imager.

If you want your automatic rendered Picture, create a PR with your Call and the URL against maps.json or simply contact some of the collaborators.

## Notes
* It may take up to one hour until the first map is rendered after your PR is merged here.
* WIaaS is highly experimental currently. We reserver the right to remove your slug, if there's a problem with it.
  * If this happens, we're going to contact you (if you provided contact informations)
* WIaaS checks every 10minutes for updates on your wavelog (New QSOs).
  * If there's a new QSO, the map will be rendered.
  * If theres no update on your side, the old Map will be cached.
